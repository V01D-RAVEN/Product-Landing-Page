    <p>The Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is a mobile phone that was released in 2022</p>
    <p>This phone was the last one to use a lighting port, which was the original chargers for IPhones since years before.</p>
    <p>The design of the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max is almost identical to older iPhone models, such as the iPhone 12 Pro and 13 Pro. The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max have a new front camera called the Dynamic Island. The Dynamic Island can now bubble up alerts instead of having a notification. This new feature is on the new iPhone 15 series (iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max). The iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max are available in four colors: Silver, Space Black, Gold and Deep Purple. Deep Purple replaced the Sierra Blue color used on the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.</p>
    <p>It is the final iPhone model in the exterior design to come with the stainless steel form factor along with the gold color option.</p>
    <p>The price ranges about 500$ - 100$+</p>
    <p>The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max feature a new A16 Bionic system on a chip (SoC), built on TSMC's N4 fabrication process, superseding the A15 Bionic seen on the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro lineup, the 3rd generation iPhone SE, and the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus.</p>
